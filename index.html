            <h2>My history</h2>
            <p>Since I was a little child, I have had a big curiosity. I was always trying to learn everything that I could, and when I grew up, this did not change. I have already taken courses in mechanics, welding, drawing, and 3D modeling. I have also done tattoos on my friends and myself! In my previous jobs, I made furniture, and I started to show ability in every step, seeing it as an opportunity to grow. In one year, I transitioned from projects to product development using Promob Software. After this turning point in my life, I decided that developing systems would be my career!

            <p>
                I created this site not just for my portfolio! I want to give something back to our community! I always ask myself why I can't find places that provide repositories. I always save some projects, simple projects only for comparison, to remember the basics! I will try to give this to our community and, at the same time, provide English exercises. I hope that I can help anyone with this and change some lives!
