        <h3>This is not the end</h3>
        <p>As you can see in this part of my code, my main class represents the beginning of something bigger. It’s not just a component with its measurements; in the process, I created the Builder system. I felt the need to implement something in production, not just at the end of the process.

          What does the Builder do? It creates the machining process that can be used on CNC machines for all structural and visual details. In this case, I created a simple base for a cabinet and designed the basic process for a minifix, which helps to attach the base to the side piece. I'm referring to the “minifix” and also included the “buiSerraCopo,” a test for larger holes that we typically make for electrical wires, included here just as an example.
          
          In this case, I used the main class, but I intend to use it in an implementation with the system screen. This part of the system can be used in engineering to create budgets with cabinet information, and it allows for the production of cabinets of any size with the engineering fully completed.</p>

            Json to Real Life
          </h3>
          <p>
            After developing the basic Builder system, I created the capability to perform a square CNC operation. In this class, you can input the initial positions on the X and Y axes, as well as the width and height. This operation is commonly used for built-in ovens and stoves, but you can use your imagination to create any type of work.

            In this implementation, I searched for some files that I knew had implementations with CNC machines. I'm not certain if they are truly different, but the API I observed uses a simple JSON format.

            What is the real challenge for this system to become more extensive and functional?

            I don't have access to any CNC machines to connect with the API. I know that all the necessary files need to specify the face on which the CNC code will be executed, as some parts have holes for structural engineering on both sides. However, how do I determine which side it is?

        <h3>The Json</h3>
        <p>
          As you can see, I created the capability for the MDF class to receive a list of Builder objects. This handles all the engineering work, allowing me to extract the JSON and use it with any CNC machine (as I believe most CNC machines operate on this principle).

          All these processes are performed using a milling cutter, which we use for most of our tasks. However, we also have another tool in the CNC machine, the saw, which plays a significant role in the work. Most of the base and side pieces require operations with the saw, and I am uncertain about how to pass the properties needed to use it.

      <h3>Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        This project has been a tremendous learning experience for me, particularly in understanding the backend of an application. Through this endeavor, I have learned how to handle complex engineering tasks, generate JSON outputs for CNC machines, and create dynamic processes using a list of Builder objects within the MDF class.<br>

        One of the significant outcomes of this project was the creation of an image label, showcasing the results of my work. This involved not only backend development but also the practical application of image creation and manipulation.

        The project helped me grasp the intricacies of JSON communication more effectively, making it more tangible and easier to comprehend. I am now more confident in my ability to manage data interchange between systems and ensure seamless operation.

        I am eager to work on larger projects to achieve even more impactful results. My goal is to continuously learn and adapt, and I particularly enjoy being challenged with new technologies. I thrive on problem-solving and constantly seek to enhance my development and logical reasoning skills.

        As I pursue a career in programming, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects and be part of a dynamic team. I am open to new challenges and committed to continuous improvement, always aiming to deliver high-quality solutions.
