        <h3>The project Begin</h3>
        <p>We now that every project starts with on problem that we have, he come with the solution and i saw the problem with MDF pieces in furniture industries and i tried to solve with a system. 

          How i begun the project? As i am a Java developer i tried to understand how create all the material things in code, so i create a class named MDF, the object that have all atributes that i need to now or change in the process.
          
          ** I know that if i tried to make my system bigger, with ERP modules, prices modules and other necessity probably the class needed more and more information, but this project is more based in a study case, so i don’t think in a big system **
          
          As you can see in the “Tela de Cadastro” i put the information that the user need to complete as he get more and more pieces, in addiction i create one input called “Área para Cadastrar” that is a real place named to help the user organized and when he need to take this piece he find easily.</p>

          <h3>
            List the Pieces
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since the start of the project i now that i have to use a Database so i connect with MySQL. I created a simple Table that have all the information based on MDF class, and connect with JDBC, i will show you in more details in the code section.

In this implementation we don’t have too many options to search for so i created what i think the user will needed, start with the more importante that is by texture, you can put the texture code and the system give back all the options in the data base. The most part we used this situation because you lost or break any product and you need to replace the piece, and we can’t have a different color in the same cabinet. We have the thickness option that we used when wee need to take some piece for structural parts and the texture don’t make any difference and the last option is by the Area, most part is used to confirme some mesures if saw the piece manually first.

        <h3>Texture Screen</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important things is the texture, in furniture industry we work with more than one type os material, you can have the MDF and MDP, in fact we have more than two material but this two is the most used and maybe is you use another type maybe they need mor atributes in the system, so you don’t used the system to management.

          Beside of Material we have the texture, when the material have a wood texture that means they need to be treated completely different, when you start a project with this type of material you need to think about the wood texture direction, and this interfere in cut process, in general, wood texture have a big loss because in the process of optimization the direction can make a lot of pieces on the other hand the solid textures they can be cut without direction because is a solid texture and give us a better optimization so the data based have a binary column named “Veio”, that help the system give us this information.

      <h3>Log Information</h3>
      <p>
        We now that in every system is important to now whats is happening so every data base communication i write in a file what the user do, in this case i use only to now if someone already take some piece or if they add a piece in the system os just put in the Áreas without the process in the system.

In fact i just did this part of the system because i want to use the write file implementation and was a success! Now I will show you some part of the code and latter i show what i do after this project because when i finished this simple project i want to implementation bigger things and try more complex implementations!!!
